## How do I fetch multiple pages? What is a 'query hash'?

The query hash is used by instagram to validate internal
api calls. You only need to do this once, and can reuse it.

- open up instagram.com
- visit any user
- open up the inspector
- trigger an xhr request
- extract the `query_hash` id from the query string
